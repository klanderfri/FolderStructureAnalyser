Session
	Create SessionUserControl to inherit.
	Better handling of Session (subscribing to session set event?).

Settings
	Make the application store changes in ribbon/grid/tree layout.
	Save settings between runs.
	
Graphical updates
	Create own application icon (in SVG-format).
	The icon indicating additional clone folder should be red (a red plus sign) instead of green as it is a problem.
	Remove the wait forms and replace by a running marquee in the status bar so the forms don't hinder the user from keeping working.
	Add information to the comparer about how many difference was found.
	Replace status bar with information panel
	
Functionality
	Make the BackgroundWorker report a difference object back so the grid can be updated while the user is waiting.
	Add files in the folder structure analyser.
	Add more information columns in the comparer grid (for example what attributes differ and the sizes of the files).
