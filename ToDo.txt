Session
	Create SessionUserControl to inherit.
	Better handling of Session (subscribing to session set event?).

Code smell
	It doesnt look good that DiskItemNode is validating its state in the IsFolder and not in a constructor.

Settings
	Save settings between runs.
	
Graphical updates
	Create own application icon (in SVG-format).
	The icon indicating additional clone folder should be red (a red plus sign) instead of green as it is a problem.
	Remove the wait forms and replace by a running marquee in the status bar so the forms don't hinder the user from keeping working.
	Add information to the comparer about how many difference was found.
	Add more information columns in the comparer grid (for example what attributes differ and the sizes of the files).
	
Functionality
	Make the BackgroundWorker report a difference object back so the grid can be updated while the user is waiting.
	Add right-click/context menu for the tree list with options to remove the folder/file.
	Add unavailable folders to the information panel.
	Find out how to make FirstOrDefault search most efficently when the item most likely is in the end (method: OperationMessageLogCtrl.removeLogMessage).
	Is it possible to add shortcut commands for certain functionalities? Like Ctrl+A to run an analysis of the folder structure?
	Add log message for cancelled operation.
	Add the original sender to log messages.
	Add more information to the log messages about changed settings.
	Create better form/handling for application level exceptions (user input, sen-in functionality).
