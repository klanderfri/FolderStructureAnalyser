	Better handling of Session (subscribing to session set event?).

	Save settings between runs.
	Setting for how the sizes are shown (dynamic, static as MB, or static as byte).
	
Graphical updates
	Create own application icon (in SVG-format).
	The icon indicating additional clone folder should be red (a red plus sign) instead of green as it is a problem.
