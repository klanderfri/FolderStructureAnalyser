Session
	Create SessionUserControl to inherit.
	Better handling of Session (subscribing to session set event?).

Code smell
	It doesnt look good that DiskItemNode is validating its state in the IsFolder and not in a constructor.
	Create better handling of colour settings. Right know there need to be 5 rows of duplicated code for each colour settings.

Graphical updates
	The icon indicating additional clone folder should be red (a red plus sign) instead of green as it is a problem.
	Add unavailable folders to the information panel.
	Add log message for cancelled operation.
	Add more information to the log messages about changed settings.
	Add information to the comparer about how many difference was found.
	Add buttons for resetting settings and layout.
	Add more information columns in the comparer grid (for example what attributes differ and the sizes of the files).
	Create better form/handling for application level exceptions (user input, send-in functionality).
	Add right-click/context menu for the tree list with options to remove the folder/file.
	
Functionality
	Make the BackgroundWorker report a difference object back so the grid can be updated while the user is waiting.
	Find out how to make FirstOrDefault search most efficently when the item most likely is in the end (method: OperationMessageLogCtrl.removeLogMessage).
	Is it possible to add shortcut commands for certain functionalities? Like Ctrl+A to run an analysis of the folder structure?
	Add the original sender to log messages.

For version 1.0:
	Remove the wait forms and replace by a running marquee in the status bar so the forms don't hinder the user from keeping working.
